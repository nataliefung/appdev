CS 1998 Final Project – Natalie Fung (nf238)Description: This is a dictionary app that can provide the user with the pronunciation, definition, etymology, and synonyms of any given word.Requirement 1: Programmatic Layout	The app was built entirely programmatically, without the use of Storyboards.Requirement 2: Multiscreen Application	The app has three possible screens: the home screen (ViewController), where users can search for words; the definition screen (WordDefinitionViewController), where users can view a word’s pronunciation, definition, and etymology; and the synonyms screen (SynonymViewController), where users can view a list of synonyms of the word.Requirement 3: API Integration	This app makes use of the Oxford Dictionaries API (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/) to get a word’s pronunciation, definition, etymology, and synonyms.Requirement 4: CollectionView & TableView Usage	In SynonymViewController, synonyms are displayed in a UITableView in SynonymTableViewCells.Requirement 5: Two Complex Components	The app has a search functionality using a UISearchBar on the home screen. My intention was also to implement a feature where users could save certain words to a “My Words” list as my second complex component, but unfortunately I was not able to figure this out in time for the project deadline.
